A: The streamer can use any wallhack, but I recommend the \"Ghost Chams\"  wallhack, as it's subtle.</p> <p>Q: Does this auto-update scores during the game? A: Yes, it runs in the spectator's  game, and everything updates automatically without intervention.</p> <p>Q: Can I change the graphics? A: Yes, you can modify any of the HUD graphics by downloading the HUD pk3  and updating the graphics there.  Note that changing their size may not change  their size in game as their size is hard-coded.</p> <p>Q: How does it know which player is on which team? A: You use the custom HUD cvars <code>hud.team1.tag</code> and <code>hud.team2.tag</code> to  tell the HUD which player tags to look for for each team.</p> <p>Q: Can I use the HUD with Volute? A: No; the participating players use Volute as normal, and the streamer  does not.</p>"},{"location":"Tools/hud/#hotkeys","title":"Hotkeys","text":"<p>Left ALT key is the master key.

Depending on the  configuration of the server, it rate-limits clients who are seen as  \"spamming\", and as a result may ignore some commands.</p> <p>This affects any commands sent to the server that are \"rate-limited\", not just  \"reload\", although that might be most visible.
