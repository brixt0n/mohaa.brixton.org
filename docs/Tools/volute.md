# Volute Anticheat
This is a client-side anticheat, following in the footsteps of:

- DMW
- Pandora
- UAC / UAC2 / UAC3
- MOHAAC
- AlphaMAC

You can find the homepage at [volute.io](https://volute.io).

## Features
Volute aims to be more than just an anti-cheat, although it is effective 
against all known cheats, and has generic detections in place which can result 
in a future ban (similar to VAC).

Through its in-game menu (F7 hotkey), it provides access to features including:

- Player overview.  Show in-game IDs, Volute IDs and status of all players in 
the server.
- Server administration.  The ability to save `rcon` or `Reborn` credentials 
and offer commands such as player kick/ban and map changes via a convenient 
menu rather than using the console.
- Game customisations.  Users can set custom avatars, "fake fullscreen" mode
(windowed without borders), custom crosshairs, custom horizontal FOV for 
modern resolutions / aspect-ratios, and more.

It also has options to help manage your server via `rcon` on the website, 
including periodic kicks (every 2 minutes) of any player without Volute or 
using a VPN.  This helps server administrators stay on top of cheaters and 
trolls.

More documentation coming soon.
